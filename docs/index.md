# What is Warehaus?

Warehaus is a collaboration tool for hardware.

Say that you have a data-center, in the cloud or on-premise. Whether this data-center has 10, 100 or 1000 users, there are always some communication issues:

* Users sometimes need to get new hardware, **so they go to the devops guy/gal**
* Users sometimes don't need a piece of hardware anymore and can give it to someone else, **so they do nothing about it**
* Someone wants to know if some specific server is being used right now, **so people send annoying spam**
* Someone needs the devops guy/gal to do something that requires privileged access, **so they talk to the devops guy/gal**

## So that's just how it is, no?

No :)

## What can Warehaus do?

In its core, Warehaus tracks and displays your data-centers to everyone in your company:

* It can show everyone the list of all your servers - physical, VMs, in the cloud or on-site
* You can organize servers into clusters
* People can take and release hardware, or give their hardware to someone else
* Everyone can see who owns which server or cluster
* All the hardware information is visible to everyone - CPUs, RAM, disk, network information, PCI devices
* If something goes wrong, people can see that a server is offline and when it comes back online

There are lots of other features and many more to come!

## Sounds awesome! How does it work?
