When you open Warehaus for the first time you'll see this screen:

![First Setup Screenshot](/assets/img/first-setup-form.png)

After filling in your LDAP server details you're also asked for the username and password of the to-be admin user. Warehaus doesn't store passwords, this step is required to verify your LDAP settings.

Once you click **Test Settings** Warehaus will test and show you the details it fetched according to your configuration. An example screen:

![First Setup Confirm](/assets/img/first-setup-confirm.png)

If something is wrong click **No** and fix any field that had a wrong value. If everything looks ok, click **Yes**. Then you'll be taken to the login screen.
