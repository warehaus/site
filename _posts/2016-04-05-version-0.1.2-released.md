Version 0.1.2 includes lots of new features, mainly better user management, improvements to the type system, and a simplified installation process. As always, this version is distributed  as a Docker container: `warehaus/warehaus:v0.1.2`.

# New Features

* User management:
  * New in-database user store
* Agent improvements:
  * Send information about root filesystem, CPU and RAM
  * Server hardware is created with actual types and objects
  * AWS metadata extraction
* Detailed server page showing all hardware
* New editor for hardware types in lab management page
* New user-attributes support
  * Define allowed attributes in lab management page for each hardware type, including sub-types such as PCI devices
  * Users can view and change attributes directly in object pages

# Changes From v0.1.1

* Rebranding as Warehaus
* New navigation design
* Removed *first setup* procedure, a clean install comes with an `admin`:`admin` user
* Authentication APIs are in their own process now

# Upgrading From v0.1.1

* To upgrade from v0.1.1 please delete the `settings` table.
* Objects and users will be kept but for new features you'd have to delete existing types and recreate them through the UI.
* As LDAP is not supported in this release, you'd have to manually reset the password for existing users. If you have too many users, please wait for an LDAP-supporting release before upgrading.
